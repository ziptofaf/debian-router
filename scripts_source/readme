Here are the sources of C++ binaries that will work on changing config files 
in /etc, perform root level commands etc. Compile them and under same name
(just without .cpp) shove into /scripts. They will need to be ran under root
level (no real way around it so make sure they are NOT writable by any lower
level user). 
Example:
wifi_off.cpp -> compile to wifi_off, put it into /scripts
Then use chown root and chmod u+x on it.
